Simple linear regression
===================================
y = a0 + a1*x  


^^^ Assuming that n-data, P1,P2....Pn  in 2D space with 
xy-axis are given in the above formula...Simple linear
regression is a method to identify the following model of this
data set where:

	a0 --> regression coefficients
	a1 --> regression coefficients
	y --> response
	x --> regressor


Approximation of the data distribution using a straight line.

	yih  = a0 + a1*xi 


^^^ where xi is the x-coordinate of point Pi.  The error ei
between the y-coordinate of point Pi and the estimated value 
yi  is defined as follows:

	ei = yi - yih


	The identification of th e model is to obtain a0 and a1 which is to 
	minimize the error E given by :

		E = summation(e2)  from i=1 --> n
		E = summation(a0 + a1*xi )  from i=1 --> n


	The coefficients a0 and a1 satisfy the following equations:

	dE/da0 = 0
	dE/da1 = 0
