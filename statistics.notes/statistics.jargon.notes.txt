Data
----------------------------------------
Data are the actual pieces of information that you collect through our study.

Numberical data:
	These data have meaning as a measurement such as blood pressure
	distance, IQ, population
Discreet data:
	Items that can be counted; but take on values that can listed out....finite or
	indifinte.
	For example....the number of heads in a 100 coin flip takes on values
	from 1 -> 100, but the number of flips needed to get 100 heads takes on the 
	range of 100 to infinity.
Continuous data:
	data that represents measurements; their possible values cannot be counted and can only be
	described using intervals on the real number line.
	For example, the exact amount of gas purchased at the pump for cars with 20-gallon tansks represents nearly-continuus data from 0.00
	gallons to 20.00 gallons, represented by the interal[0,20] inclusives(we can actually count these values by why 
	would you want to ?)
Categorical data:
	Catgetorical data represents charactdristics such as a person's gender, marital status, hometown, or the
	types of movies they like
Ordinal data:
	mixes umberical and categorical data.  the data falls into categories, but the 
	numbes placed on the categories ahve meaning.
	For example, rating a restuarant on a scal from 0 to 4 stars gives ordinal data.  Ordinal data are often treated as categorical, where the groups are ordered when graphs and chats are made.  I don't address them separately in this book
DataSets:"
	A data set is the collection of all the data taken from your sample.  For example, if you measured the weights of five packages, and those
Population:
	For virtually any question you may want to investigate about the world, you have to center your attentionf fon a particular groupd of
	individuals(for example, a group of poeple, cities, animals, rock specimmens, exam scores, and so on)
	For example:
		Waht do Americans thnk about the president's foreign policy?
		What precentage of planted crops in wisconsin did deer destory last year ?
		What's the prognosis for breast cancer patients taking anew experimental drug?
		What percentage of all cereal boxes get filled according to specification ?
	This is basically identifying a specifc group of indiviculas being studied and within it...identify subgroups to be studied:
		American peiople
		lanted crops in Wisconsin
		breast cancer patients
		cereial boxes being filled
	Note:
		Make sure that the populations you sample are broad.  Narrow
		group sampling will provide narrow results
	Note:
		Randomness of sampling within a general group keeps the experment honest

Statistic
=============================
A statistic is a number that summaries the data collected from a sample.
For example:
	60% of US households own a car
	The average price of a home
	A median salary for the 1000 computer scientits in the sample was
	The weight of babies in the 90th percentile

Not all stats are correct or fair...remember this.....nothing guarantees
that the statisti is scientific or legitimate.
Figures don't lie...but liars figure...

Parameters
=============================
The bounds placed upon the experiment...those involved in the experiment..
their treatment...and the data used in the experiment....not to mention
any minutae such as logictics for actually conducting the expriment....
