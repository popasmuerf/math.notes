Statistics basics
===========================
* Some stats are:
	-vague
	-innapropiate
	-plain wrong


Designing Appropiate Studies
============================
*Studies are done based on a question that needs to be answered (A Hypothesis test)
*The design of the study is just as important as it's results
*A flawed design leads to flawed results
* Good and credible experiments 


Types of Studies
==============================
Observational:
-data is collected on individuals without directly affecting them
-most common form is the "survey" where questionairs are sent/presented
to populations of interest
-Takes many different forms from paper forms to web forms, to call-in-polls
-Prone to providing bogus results resulting from inappropiate questioning

Experiments:
-Imposes one or more treatments on the participants in such
a way that clear and concise comparisons can be made
-Good and credible experiments are designed to:
	*Minimize bias
	*Collect lots of good data
-Promblems regarding experiment related studies are:
	*researchers/subjects knowning in advance their treatment
	*factors beyond the controll of the study that affect outcumes
	*lack of a control group which leaves no baseline to compare results
-Correctly designed experimental studies establish clear cause and effect relationship via varying
responses to the treatment between the control and treatment groups(assuming that the difference is 
statistically significant...meaning that outcomes are less a product of chance)


Collecting quality Data
================================
After a study has been designed , be it a aruvey or an experiment, the individuals
who will particpate have to be selected, and process must be in placd to 
collect the data.  this pahse of the process is critical to producing credible dta int
the end


Selecting decent samples
===============================
*"Garbage in == Garbage out":
	-Biased selection of subjects then the results will be biased and thus inaddmissable
*subjects should be a cross-section of any given population
*randomization provides a decent cross-section of subjects
*questions of ethics come into play when selecting cross-sections as any study is subjecting your
subjects to treatment.  There are ways to deal with this.

Creating Effective Summaries
================================
After collection good data, the next step is to summarize them to 
get a handle on the big picture.  Statisticians
describe data in two major ways:
	1. Numbers(descriptive statistics)
	2. Pictures(charts, graphs)

Descriptive statistics
==================================
Descriptive statistics are numbers that describe a data set in terms of its
important features:
	1. If the data is categorical(where individuals are placed into groups)
		they are typically summarized using the number
		of individuals in each groups(called the frequency) or the precentage of
		individuals  in each group or the percentae of indiviuals in each
		group (called the relative frequency)
	2. Numerical data represents measurements or counts, where the actual
		numbers have meaning(such as height or weight).  Numerical data, allows
		for more features that can be summarized besides the number or prercentage in each group:
			* Measures of center(where is the "middle")
			* Measures of spread(how diverse or how concentrated ais the data arnoud the center?)
			* If appropiate, numbes that easure the relationship between two variabls(such as height and weight)


Determining Distributions
==================================
A variable is a characteristic that's being:
	*Counted
	*measured
	*catgorized
A distribution is a lising of the possible values of a variable(intervals of values)
and how often (or at what density) they occur

Example:
	The dist. of gender at birth in the United Stages has been est. at:
		52.4% maile
		47.6.% female
Different types of dist. exist for different type of variables
The most commonly occuring distributions in an intrductory stats course are as follows:
	*binomial distribution:
		Variable counts the number of successes versus the number of fails
	*Normal distribution
		Variables whom's range of possible data plots out in a bell shape
	*T-distribution
		Variables whome's range of possible data plots out according to averages


What we need to know about distrubtions
====================================
Things to decide:
	* What is the dist of the variable ?
	* Waht are the probablilities of the for it ?
	* What is the long term average  for it ?
	* What is the standard  deviation ?



Summary Quick
=====================================
1. Collect Data:
	*Survey
	*Experiment
2. Describe Data:
	*Categorize
	*Numericize
3. Statistical Analysis of data


Margin of error and conficence intervals
======================================
You often see statistics that try to estimate numbers pertaining to 
and entire population; in fact, you see them almost every day in the form of seruvey results.

* You cannot include everyone into you sample, there for you must include a decent cross section
of a sizable sample.
* Sample results vary from sample to sample, and thus an amount of variablility needs to be
reported (but often isn't).
* The statistic used to measure and report the level of precision in someone's sample results
is called:
	-The Margin of error
* The "error" in "Margin of error" does not mean a mistake was made; it just means that because you didn't sample the entire population, a gap will exist between your results and the actual value you are trying to 
estimate for the population.
* The Confidence Interval is the exact oposite of the Margin of Error

Example:
	out of a sample of 1,200 people, 60% think that Nikki's tits are fucking perfect.
	with a +/- 2% margin of error
	* The margin of error is 2% of 1,200 people == 240 people  may or may not truly represent the sample size
	* The range of the confidence interval = 60% +/- 2 %  = 58% confidence level


Correlations, regression, and twopway tables
==========================================
One of the most common goals of research is to find lings between variables:
Example:
	Which lifestyle behaviros incdreased or decreased the risk of cancer?
	What side effects are associated with this new drug ?
	Can I lower my cholesterol by taking this new herbal supplement
	Does spending a large amount of time on the Internet cause a person to gain weight ?
