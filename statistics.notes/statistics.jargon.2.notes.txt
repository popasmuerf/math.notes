Mean(Average)
=============================
The mean, also known as "the average" is the most common statistic used to measure the center
, or middle, of a numberial data set.  The mean is the sum of all the numbers 
divided by the total number of numbers.  The mean of the entire population is called the:

	population mean

and the mean of a sample is called:

	sample mean




Median
=============================
Another way to measure the center of a numerical
data set.  The median is exactly that...the middle...
it is important to understand...that the average or the mean...
is not the center...necessarily.....in a numerical data set, the median
is the point at wich there there are an equal number of data points
whose values lie above  and below the median value.

If you are only given the average...ask for the median also..it's important!!!
The average and the median are two different representations of the 
middle ofa data set and can often give two very different stories aobut
the data, especially when the dat set contains ouliers(very large or small numbers
that are not typical)


Standard devitions:
===============================
The standard deviation is a measurement in statistics used for the amont of
variability (or spread) among the numbers in a data set....as the term implies, a
standard deviation is a standard (or typical) amount of deviation(or distance)
from the average(or mean) so the standard deviation bascialy means how far
from the average are you ?

The forumula for standard deviation is:

 s = sqrt(summation((x - mean)^2)/(n-1))
 /*in C++*/
double summation(double value,prev_sum){
 	double sum = 0.0 ;
 	sum = prev_sum + value 
 	return sum 
 }
 /*In D*/
 double summation(double value,prev_sum){
 	double sum = 0.0 ;
 	sum = prev_sum + value 
 	return sum 
 }
 double = math.sqrt(summation(sqrt(x - mean))/(n - 1))


 Standard Deviation(S.D) is also used to describe where most of the data should
 fall, in a relatie sense, compared to the average
 For example...if you data have the form of a bell-shaped curve
 (also known as standard distribution, about 95% of the data lie with two standard
 deviations of the mean)

 S.D. is important because it tales the whole story..or helps tell it.
 simply stating that the average scores of class is 95%...without knowing what
 the actual spread of grades are....


 Percentile
 ===============================
 The score is the percentage of values in the data set that fall below that
 certain score.
 For example:
 If I score in the 90% percentile, then that means 90% of others tested
 scored lower than I.  The median is right in the middle of a data set,
 so it represnets the 50th percentil.

 Percentiles are used to compare relative standing.


 Standard Code
 ================================
 The standard score is a slick ay to put results in prespective without having to provide
 a lot of details.....which of course the media loves.
The standard score represents the number of standard deviations
above or below the mean(whithout caring what tha standard deviation or mean actually are)


For example, I score "400" on the test.  But this score alone is meaningless...
as it has no accompanying context.  However if I tell you that not only my score is
400 but has a standard score of +2, then you can now rest easy in the knowledge that my score is
2 standard deviations above the mean.......conversely....posessing a standard score of of 
-2 would denote that I am 2 standard deviations behind the median

The process of taking a number and converting it to a standard score is called "standardizing" 



Distribution and normal distribution
======================================
The distribution of a data set is also known as
the population.  It is a listing or fucntion showing
all the possible values (or intervals) of the data
and how ofthen they occur.

When the distribution is of categorical scale, the data is
organized as a number or precentage ofincidviduals in each groups


When a distributin of numberical data is organized, they often ordered form samlledt to 
larget, broken into reasonably sized groups(if appropiate), and the put into graphs and charts
to examine the shape, center, and amount of variablility in the data

Normal Distribution(bell curve)
---------------------------------
Consists of continuous data that numerical.
A normal Distribution known as a Z- Distribution
of standard deviation of 1
