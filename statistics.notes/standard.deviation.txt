Normal Distribution
===========================
Data can be "distributed" (spread out) in different ways.
* Left
* right
* jumbled

However  there ar many cases where the data tends to be around 
a enteral value with no bias left or right.
...and it approaches close to a "Normal Distribution" that 
graphs out to resembe a bell curve.



Many things closely follow a Normal Distribution
====================================================
* heights of people
* size of things produced by machines
* errors in measurements
* blood pressures
* marks on a test


The normal Distribution has thes attributes:
	* mean = median = mode
	* symmetry about the center
	* 50% values less than the mean
	* 50% values greater than the mean




Standard Deviation
===========================
In statisticst, the standard deviation(SD or sigma)
is a measure that is used to quantifty the amount of variation
or dispersion of a set of data values.  A low standard deviation indicates
that the data points tend to be close to the mean(also the expecte value).

The standard Deviation is a measure of how spread out numbers are w/r
to a normal distribution and how to calculate
it.




for example the mean of the following:

mean = (1 + 2 + 3 -1 -2 -3)/6 = 0

We calculate the standard deviation via calculating the individual deviations
of each data point from the mean, and then square the result of each:

Calculate individual deviations from
the mean
----------------------------
(1 - 0 )^2 = 1
(2  - 0)^2 = 4
(3 - 0 )^2 = 9
(-1  - 0)^2 = 1
(-2  - 0)^2 = 4
(-3  - 0)^2 = 9

Calculate the variance (mean)
of the individual deviations
----------------------------

(1 - 0 )^2 = 1 
			 +
(2  - 0)^2 = 4
			 +
(3 - 0 )^2 = 9
			 +
(-1 - 0)^2 = 1
			 +
(-2 - 0)^2 = 4
			 +
(-3 - 0)^2 = 9
variance   = 28 /2 = 14

The population standard deviation is equal to the square root of the variance

 |-----
 | 14    = 3.7416573867739413  
V



with a standard deviation of a random variable, statistical population,
data set, or probablity distribution is the square root of its variance


What is SD used for ?
============================
*Expression of variability of a population
*Confidence of statistical conclusions(example margin of errors)
*Calculating standard errors of margin or standard error of the mean
* Calculation of risk in finance
* Geometric interpretation
